# connections
An app based on the NYT Connections game


The app must allow for user input to create games. 
Four incorrect guesses will mean game over.
Previously guessed combinations will not count as an incorrect guess and users will be notified.
Board can be shuffled.
A log of guesses, correct and incorrect, will be displayed as a result. 
A 'One Away' notification should show when users select three out of four in a group


Still to implement: 

  Overall styling, including animating transitions.

  Interactivity from user input.
